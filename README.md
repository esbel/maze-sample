Nice little example on how to generate & solve a maze in ruby :)

The main intention of this solution is to show how to structure partial
implementation in a way that in future it will be easy to plug into what is de
facto standard for code organisation in Ruby on Rails applications.
Specifically, it shows an example on how to deliver well structured, modular
code with shared domain definition (Coordinates system).
